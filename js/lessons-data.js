        coldOpen: "Legal warns about accessibility lawsuit risk. Your competitor just settled for £500k. The dev team says our site works fine. What do you need to know?",
        coldRevisit: "Accessibility is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions (ADA, EAA, WCAG). 'Works fine' often means 'works for people like us'. 15% of users have disabilities. Semantic HTML helps everyone—screen readers, SEO, and maintenance.",
        content: "<h2>Why This Matters to You</h2><p>Accessibility isn't just about compliance—though the legal risk is real. In 2023, over 4,000 web accessibility lawsuits were filed in the US alone. But beyond legal risk, accessible sites reach more customers, rank better in search, and are easier to maintain.</p><h2>1. Semantic HTML: Meaning Over Appearance</h2><p>HTML elements carry meaning. Using the right element helps browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies understand your content.</p><pre>&lt;!-- Bad: Divs mean nothing to assistive technology --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"header\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"nav\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"nav-item\"&gt;Products&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Good: Semantic elements convey structure --&gt;\n&lt;header&gt;\n  &lt;nav&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"/products\"&gt;Products&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/nav&gt;\n&lt;/header&gt;</pre><h3>Key Semantic Elements</h3><table><tr><th>Element</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Screen Reader Behavior</th></tr><tr><td><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></td><td>Page or section header</td><td>Announced as banner landmark</td></tr><tr><td><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></td><td>Navigation links</td><td>Announced as navigation landmark</td></tr><tr><td><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></td><td>Primary content</td><td>Users can skip directly to main content</td></tr><tr><td><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></td><td>Self-contained content</td><td>Announced as article</td></tr><tr><td><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></td><td>Related but separate content</td><td>Announced as complementary</td></tr><tr><td><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></td><td>Page or section footer</td><td>Announced as contentinfo landmark</td></tr><tr><td><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></td><td>Clickable action</td><td>Announced as button, keyboard accessible</td></tr></table><div class=\"info-box\"><div class=\"info-title\">💡 The Landmark Test</div><p>Screen reader users navigate by landmarks (header, nav, main, footer). If your site is all divs, they hear nothing useful. Ask your team: Can a screen reader user navigate our site by landmarks?</p></div><h2>2. Accessibility Fundamentals (WCAG)</h2><p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define accessibility standards. Level AA is typically the legal requirement.</p><h3>The Four Principles: POUR</h3><table><tr><th>Principle</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Example Requirement</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Perceivable</strong></td><td>Users can perceive content</td><td>Images have alt text, videos have captions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Operable</strong></td><td>Users can interact</td><td>Everything works with keyboard, no seizure-inducing flashes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Understandable</strong></td><td>Content is clear</td><td>Consistent navigation, error messages explain how to fix</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Robust</strong></td><td>Works with assistive tech</td><td>Valid HTML, ARIA used correctly</td></tr></table><h2>3. Common Accessibility Failures</h2><h3>Images Without Alt Text</h3><pre>&lt;!-- Bad: Screen reader says \"image\" or reads filename --&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"product-xyz-123.jpg\"&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Good: Descriptive alt text --&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"product-xyz-123.jpg\" alt=\"Blue wireless headphones with noise cancellation\"&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Good: Decorative image, empty alt --&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"decorative-swoosh.png\" alt=\"\"&gt;</pre><h3>Fake Buttons</h3><pre>&lt;!-- Bad: Looks like button but isn't accessible --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"button\" onclick=\"addToCart()\"&gt;Add to Cart&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Problems: --&gt;\n&lt;!-- - Can't be focused with Tab key --&gt;\n&lt;!-- - Screen reader doesn't announce as button --&gt;\n&lt;!-- - Enter/Space don't activate it --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Good: Real button with all accessibility built in --&gt;\n&lt;button onclick=\"addToCart()\"&gt;Add to Cart&lt;/button&gt;</pre><h3>Color-Only Information</h3><pre>&lt;!-- Bad: Color alone indicates sale --&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"red\"&gt;£49.99&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;!-- Colorblind users can't tell --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Good: Text and icon supplement color --&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"sale-price\"&gt;\n  &lt;span class=\"visually-hidden\"&gt;Sale price:&lt;/span&gt;\n  £49.99 🏷️\n&lt;/span&gt;</pre><h3>Missing Form Labels</h3><pre>&lt;!-- Bad: Placeholder disappears, no label for screen reader --&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email address\"&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Good: Proper label association --&gt;\n&lt;label for=\"email\"&gt;Email address&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"email\" id=\"email\"&gt;</pre><h2>4. Keyboard Navigation</h2><p>Many users can't use a mouse—motor impairments, screen reader users, power users. Everything must work with keyboard alone.</p><h3>Key Requirements</h3><ul><li><strong>Tab order:</strong> Focus moves logically through the page</li><li><strong>Visible focus:</strong> Users can see which element is focused</li><li><strong>No keyboard traps:</strong> Users can always Tab out of any component</li><li><strong>Skip links:</strong> Skip to main content link for keyboard users</li></ul><pre>&lt;!-- Skip link (usually visually hidden until focused) --&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"#main-content\" class=\"skip-link\"&gt;Skip to main content&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- CSS to show skip link on focus --&gt;\n.skip-link {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: -9999px;\n}\n.skip-link:focus {\n  left: 10px;\n  top: 10px;\n}</pre><div class=\"warning-box\"><div class=\"warning-title\">⚠️ The Tab Test</div><p>Try navigating your site using only the Tab key and Enter. Can you: reach all interactive elements? See where focus is? Complete a purchase? If not, keyboard users can't either.</p></div><h2>5. Color Contrast</h2><p>WCAG requires minimum contrast ratios between text and background:</p><ul><li><strong>Normal text:</strong> 4.5:1 ratio minimum</li><li><strong>Large text (18px+ bold or 24px+):</strong> 3:1 ratio minimum</li><li><strong>UI components and graphics:</strong> 3:1 ratio minimum</li></ul><p>Tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker can verify your colors meet requirements.</p><h2>6. ARIA: Use Sparingly</h2><p>ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) adds accessibility information to HTML. But the first rule of ARIA is: don't use ARIA if native HTML works.</p><pre>&lt;!-- Unnecessary ARIA: button is already accessible --&gt;\n&lt;button role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Submit\"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Necessary ARIA: custom component needs ARIA --&gt;\n&lt;div role=\"tablist\"&gt;\n  &lt;button role=\"tab\" aria-selected=\"true\" aria-controls=\"panel1\"&gt;Tab 1&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;button role=\"tab\" aria-selected=\"false\" aria-controls=\"panel2\"&gt;Tab 2&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre><h2>7. Testing Accessibility</h2><h3>Automated Tools (Find ~30% of Issues)</h3><ul><li><strong>axe DevTools:</strong> Browser extension, catches common issues</li><li><strong>WAVE:</strong> Visual overlay showing issues</li><li><strong>Lighthouse:</strong> Built into Chrome DevTools</li></ul><h3>Manual Testing (Essential)</h3><ul><li><strong>Keyboard navigation:</strong> Tab through entire site</li><li><strong>Screen reader:</strong> Use VoiceOver (Mac), NVDA (Windows), or JAWS</li><li><strong>Zoom to 200%:</strong> Content should remain usable</li><li><strong>Disable CSS:</strong> Content should still be logical</li></ul><div class=\"exercise\"><h4>🔧 Practical Exercise</h4><ol><li>Install axe DevTools browser extension</li><li>Run it on your product page</li><li>Try navigating checkout with keyboard only</li><li>Document: How many issues found? Can checkout be completed?</li></ol></div>",
        questions: [
            { q: "Your site uses div onclick for all buttons. Dev says it works fine. What's wrong?", opts: ["Nothing—JavaScript handles the click", "Screen readers can't identify it as interactive; keyboard users can't Tab to it or activate with Enter", "Divs are slower than buttons", "Only affects old browsers"], correct: 1, explain: "Native button elements are focusable, keyboard operable, and announced correctly by screen readers—for free. Divs need extensive ARIA and JavaScript to achieve the same." },
            { q: "Images have alt=\"\" (empty). When is this correct?", opts: ["Never—all images need descriptions", "When the image is purely decorative and adds no information", "Always—for faster loading", "Only for background images"], correct: 1, explain: "Decorative images should have empty alt so screen readers skip them. Informative images need descriptive alt text." },
            { q: "WCAG 2.1 Level AA is often the legal standard. What does this practically mean?", opts: ["A certification you can purchase", "Specific technical requirements for color contrast, keyboard access, text alternatives, and more", "A grade from an auditor", "Only applies to government sites"], correct: 1, explain: "WCAG AA includes specific, testable requirements. Level A is minimum, AA is standard requirement, AAA is enhanced." },
            { q: "Your sale prices are red, regular prices are black. A customer complains they can't tell what's on sale. Why?", opts: ["Red is hard to see on screens", "Approximately 8% of men are colorblind. Color alone shouldn't convey information—need icon, text, or pattern too.", "They need a better monitor", "CSS issue"], correct: 1, explain: "Color blindness affects 1 in 12 men. Use multiple indicators: color AND text label AND/OR icon." },
            { q: "Developer says adding accessibility will slow down the project. Your response?", opts: ["Accessibility can wait until v2", "Building accessibly from the start is faster than retrofitting. It's also a legal requirement. What specific concerns do you have?", "Hire an accessibility specialist", "Skip accessibility for MVP"], correct: 1, explain: "Retrofitting accessibility is 10x more expensive than building it in. Legal risk is real. Address specific concerns rather than accepting delay." }

        essay: { q: "Audit your company's checkout flow for accessibility. What issues exist? What is the business and legal risk?", guide: "Run axe DevTools, test with keyboard only, check color contrast on buttons. Consider: legal exposure, lost sales from excluded users, brand reputation. Prioritize fixes by severity." }
